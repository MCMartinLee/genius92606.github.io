I"e<p>In my lab, I build a robotic car, I designed it by SolidWorks on my own and produced the component by 3DP easily. Then, I learned how to control them by Raspberry Pi with C and utilized socket.io to make the whole device controllable on SNAP, a platform allows kids to program easily. Then, I was required to teach elementary school students how to control them by using SNAP and collected the feedback to improve the feasibility of our countryâ€™s primary school programming education. As a member of the research project, it really sparked my interest in doing research even I knew the difficulty of it.</p>
