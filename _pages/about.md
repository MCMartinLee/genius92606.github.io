Hello, my name is Meng-Chen Lee, but you can call me Martin. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Houston, where I am privileged to work alongside [Dr. Zhigang Deng](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu/zdeng/) in the [Computer Graphics and Interactive Media Lab](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu/). My primary research revolves around multiparty conversation animation and simulation. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in 2019.

I am deeply passionate about technology and the pursuit of novelty. I firmly believe in the power of curiosity and the exploration of the unknown to enrich our lives and imbue them with meaning
