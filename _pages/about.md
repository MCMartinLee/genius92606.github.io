Hi, my name is Meng-Chen Lee, you can also call me Martin.<br>
I am currently a Ph.D. Computer Science student in Unviersity of Houston and working with [Dr. Zhigang Deng](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu/zdeng/) in [Computer Graphics and Interactive Media Lab](http://graphics.cs.uh.edu/). My main research focus on multiparty conversation animation and simulation. Before that, I got my bachelor degree in Nation Cheng Kung University (NCKU) in 2019 and was major in Biomedical Engineering.



<br>
I love technology and something new <br>
I believe that people should be curious, passionate, <br>
and explore the unknown to make our life meaningful.
