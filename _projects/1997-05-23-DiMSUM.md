The DiMSUM shared task at SemEval 2016 is concerned with predicting, given an English sentence, a broad-coverage representation of lexical semantics. The representation consists of two closely connected facets: a segmentation into minimal semantic units, and a labeling of some of those units with semantic classes known as supersenses.
